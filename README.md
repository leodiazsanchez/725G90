# 725G90 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Overview

This repository contains the assignments and projects completed during the **725G90 Object-Oriented Programming in Java** course at **Link√∂ping University**. The course introduced core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java, focusing on key concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Through practical coding assignments, students gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing object-oriented software solutions.

## Labs

- **Lab 0: Validate Social Security Number**  
  This lab implemented a program that validates Swedish Social Security Numbers based on specific criteria.

- **Lab 1: Inheritance and Polymorphism**  
  This lab focused on implementing inheritance and polymorphism in Java. Class hierarchies were created, allowing for the reuse of code through inheritance and the ability to override methods for specialized behavior, demonstrating the flexibility and extensibility of object-oriented systems.

- **Lab 2: Text-Based Game**  
  This lab designed and implemented a simple text-based game in Java. The project involved working with classes, objects, and methods to create an interactive experience where players make choices and navigate through different scenarios.

- **Lab 3: ADTs**  
  This lab focused on implementing and using Abstract Data Types (ADTs) such as queues, stacks, maps, and linked lists. These data structures were implemented in Java, understanding their underlying operations.

- **Lab 4: Paint Program**  
  This lab developed a simple paint program using object-oriented design principles. Various features were implemented, such as drawing shapes, selecting colors, and managing the drawing canvas. The lab taught how to use GUIs, organizing the code into a model-view structure, and implementing functionality to store and read paintings.

- **Game: Flappy Bird Clone**  
  The task of this project was to create a game of your choice. The game selected was the popular Flappy Bird. The focus was on game mechanics, collision detection, animation, and handling user input. This lab provided a fun and practical way to apply object-oriented programming concepts while building a complete interactive game.
